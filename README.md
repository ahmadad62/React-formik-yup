# Code Description:

This code is a React functional component that creates a form for a user to sign up for an account. It uses the `'useFormik'` hook from the formik library and the `Yup` library for form validation.

 The `useFormik` hook takes an object with several properties as its argument, including:
- initialValues: an object containing the initial values for the form inputs
- `validationSchema`: an object that defines the validation rules for the form inputs using Yup. In this case, it defines that the firstName and lastName inputs must be less than 15 and 20 characters respectively and are required, and the email input must be a valid email and required.
- `onSubmit`: a callback function that is called when the form is submitted. In this case, it simply logs the values of the form inputs to the console.
The component then renders a form with three inputs for first name, last name and email, and a submit button. Each input has `onChange`, `onBlur` handlers that are passed down by useFormik to update the form state and handle validation.
It also uses ternary operator to check if formik.touched and formik.errors for each input fields and if true it will display the error message next to the input field.
When the form is submitted, it will call the onSubmit function and log the formik.values to the console.

You can find more information and examples on how to use the useFormik hook and the Yup library in the official Formik and `Yup` documentation:

# Genral Information about React
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJtyp1YmOpc
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
